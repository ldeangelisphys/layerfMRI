# Figures and Data - Instruction for use

This folder contains both the figures presented in the manuscript, as well as the data and the R scripts to generate them.

In the `Scripts` subdirectory of each figure's directory there is a [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) notebook whose code details how the figures are generated from the data in the `Data` subdirectory.


**IMPORTANT :** in order for the code to run on your computer, you should change the base directory (`bd`) according to the location where you downloaded the `figures` directory. You should repeat this for _each Rmarkdown notebook_.

The code below is contained in the very first code cell of each Rmarkdown notebook with the eloquent title: `## Set up the root directory!`


```{r, setup, eval=F,include=TRUE}

# -------- CHANGE THE LINE BELOW ----------------

bd="[DOWNLOAD_DIRECTORY]/figures/"

# -----------------------------------------------


thisfigdir="fig_4_ISFC_matrices/"

datadir=paste0(bd,thisfigdir,'/Data/')
pdfdir=paste0(bd,thisfigdir,'/FigureElementsPDF/')

knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = datadir)
```

## QC figures
The QC (quality control) folder contains figures related to the following preprocessing procedures:

- **skull_stripping**: initial removal of out-of-brain tissue
- **summary_registration**: fmri to partial anatomy to full anatomy to MNI space
- **summary_inv_registration**: inverse transformation from any other space to native fmri space
- **summary_layering**: outcome of the layering procedure in nighres
- **summary_trans2native**: outcome of the transformation of the cortical depth maps and the Juelich atlas in native fmri space

These figures were automatically generated by the scripts performing the preprocessing steps ([github repo here](https://github.com/ldeangelisphys/layerfMRI/tree/main/preprocessing)) and are provided to assess the good outcome of the preprocessing.
