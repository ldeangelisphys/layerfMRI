This version of the juelich atlas has been MODIFIED to accommodate the need
to capture one blob in the occipital cortex that was not mapped in the
Juelich atlas, but which is important to consider for our experiment.

DO NOT USE FOR GENERAL PURPOSES, as the V1 and V2 regions of Juelich have been
changed due to the overlap with the added region.

The names atlas_juelich_icbm.nii.gz and labels_juelich.csv have been
preserved to allow the scripts to run. The original version of both files
has the ORIGINAL suffix, and is also located in the /juelich_original folder.

You can read all the details in the do_add_HO_to_Juelich.sh
