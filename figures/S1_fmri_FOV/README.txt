The raw data used to generate Fig. S1 are the preprocessed 4D images in MNI
space. This dataset weights a few terabytes, and the procedure to generate
the images is very straightforward. Therefore we do not include here this
dataset. However in the script folder it is possible to inspect the bash script
used to generate the images in the Data folder, which were used in Mango to
generate the final Fig. S1.
