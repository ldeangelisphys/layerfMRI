## Analytic strategy
We carried out a dual Inter-Subject Correlation (ISC) for each cortical depth bin and Juelich regions (JU ROIs) across all subjects.

**The first ISC** was carried out in the MNI space, after smoothing the data with a 6mm FWHM gaussian kernel (8 times the original voxel size). This ISC was intended to provide localizers of brain activity in either conditions. To this aim, the union of Intact ("Motion", denoted with `M`) and Scrambled (`S`) thresholded Zmaps (`M_OR_S`) was used.

Our prior hypothesis involved considering BA44, PFt and latOCC (lateral occipital). Still in the following we show the results for all the regions in the [Juelich atlas](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-1/EN/Forschung/_docs/SPMAnatomyToolbox/SPMAnatomyToolbox_node.html) where at least 100 (native space) voxels (`clusterSizeThr` below) were significantly activated in the `M_OR_S` contrast (`N_sig` below). This assessment was carried out to confirm the specificity of our experimental hypothesis with respect to our regions of interest.


**The second ISC** took as input the average (mean) time courses extracted from the **_unsmoothed_** fmri data with the following level of granularity:

- for each cortical depth bin (user-defined `nbin` below)
- for each JU ROI (N out of ~100 JU ROIs after `clusterSizeThr`)
- for each movie (18 Motion and 18 Scrambled)
- for each run (n_run = 2)
- for each subject (n_subject = 9)

For each cortical depth bin and each JU ROI, we concatenated the segments of the BOLD time course containing movie stimuli, transformed the intensity values in Z-scores and averaged the resulting values across voxels. This resulted in a time course containing the brain activity elicited by the movies for each cortical depth bin, each region of interest and each subject.



## Read csv of ISC results and prepare the environment
The input are the ISC parameter estimates obtained for each bin of each JU region in each subject.

## Data used to generate the plots for **6 bins**

Current binning: **6 cortical depth bins**

User-defined parameters in the cell above can be modified to display data and results related to other binning choices.
